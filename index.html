                Half of what you think of me <br>
                I could do about anything <br>
                I could even learn how to love <br>
             <br>
                When I see the way you act <br>
                Wondering when I'm coming back <br>
                I could do about anything <br>

                Now I'm sure that it's true <br>
                'Cause I think you're so good <br>
                And I'm nothing like you <br>
             <br>
                Look at you go <br>
                I just adore you <br>
                I wish that I knew <br>
                What makes you think I'm so special? <br>

                Something that does right by you <br>
                I would do about anything <br>
                I would even learn how to love <br>
             <br>
                When I see the way you look <br>
                Shaken by how long it took <br>
                I could do about anything <br>
                I could even learn how to love like you <br>
